**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

this is my around the us web build. It used a combination of flex bot and grid to align and position 6 seperate cards along with other elements. the website is responsive and the layout changes as you reduced or expand the viewport width.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
